# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
To turn complicated data into easily consumable visual insights, using Tableau
Create impactful dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions, based on a business questions
Communicate insights with the correct visualizations

## Process
- Deciding which project to take given the variety of datasets - which ones provided more opportunities for learning.
- Audience Analysis - It was a little unclear who the primary consumer of my dashboard would be
- Data acquisition and cleaning. The standard protocol for data cleaning and for importing into Tableau.
- EDA
- Coming up with questions.
- Creating the visuals and dashboard.

## Questions and Results

- Whats the geographic distribution of players and nationality - wise analysis of attributes?
- Which Countries or Clubs have the best player ratings and Identify best 10 clubs and countries in terms of overall player performance.
- Whats the relationship between wage and age? What is the prime age?
- Whats the relationship between Wage, Value, and Age?
- Which attributes are optimal/ best for each position?
- What are the 1. Top five players by position, 2. Top five players overall, and 3. Top 5 clubs by player attribute's.

1. Germany, Brazil, and Argentina seems to dominate with number of players in the game. There are over a thousand players of German Nationality.
2. Chile has the best overall score in-terms of player attributes. This however takes all players into account and with only 354 players it does't perform as better as Brazil with a score of 70.8 with over 600+ players.
3. The best club is FC Barcelona with an overall attribute score of 82.6. The top five best clubs are Barcelona, Juventus, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Paris Saint Germain.
4. The prime age is about 30 years, after which as players age, the wage they receive begins to substantially decrease.
5. The value and wages of players increases with age until 30 years. Beyond 30, the gap between value and wage is marginally high. even  though players still earn beyond their value.
6. All attributes decrease with age. For a Striker (CF, LS,), the most important attributes are balance, agility, dribbling, ball control, composure, and curving.


## Challenges
1. The dataset is quite old. Most of the image links are missing, some country (nationalities) are incorrect.
2. Learning curve for Tableau is quite steep.

## Future Goals
- Do more data cleaning and enrich data with current statistics/ player and club data in light of the most recently concluded world cup.
- Obtain a more recent dataset (FIFA 23)
